##Command Line Interface:

#Introduction to CLI:
    
  CLI stands for Command Line Interface. It's a text-based interface used for interacting with computer systems and software by typing commands into a terminal or command prompt. Unlike graphical user interfaces (GUI), which rely on graphical elements like windows, icons, and menus, the CLI operates entirely through text commands.
  In a CLI environment, users input commands using a keyboard, and the system responds with text output. These commands can perform a wide range of functions, from navigating file systems and managing files to executing programs and configuring system settings. CLI is often favored by developers, system administrators, and power users for its efficiency, flexibility, and scripting capabilities.

#Advantages:

  1. It allows users to type in commands that can produce immediate results. 
  2. It is quick and simple.
  3. A CLI requires less memory to use in comparison to other interfaces. It also does not use as much CPU processing time as other interfaces.
  4. It needs fewer resources, yet is highly precise. 

#Disadvantages:

  1. The main disadvantage of a command-line interface is that users must be familiar with the commands in order to maximize the above advantages.
  2. There is also zero room for error.
  3. If you type the wrong command, you could accidentally delete files or close the program before you saved your work.

#Some of the most used commands:

    #Basic Important commands:

        1. man - it stands for manual, and it gives a detailed information about a command.
        2. cd  - it stands for change directory.

        29. systemctl - allows you to start, stop, enable, and check the status of services.
        30. pgrep - five the PID.

    #OS/Process Related Commands:

        1. ps - displays information about running processes.
        2. top - displays real-time system information including running processes.
        3. df - displays disk space usage of file systems.
        4. uname - prints system information.
        5. free - displays memory usage information.
        6. lspci - lists peripheral devices connected to the computer.
        7. kill - used to terminate a process.

    #Network Related Commands:

        1. ping - tests connectivity to a network.
        2. ifconfig - configures network interfaces and displays their current status.
        3. ssh - securely connects to a remote machine over the network using the SSH protocol.
        4. netstat - used to know detailed information about the network activity.
        5. ss - similar to netstat but provides more information.
        6. blkid - shows us our hard drive.
        7. curl - transfers data to or from a server using various protocols.

    #Bash Related Commands:
    
        1. xargs - constructs argument lists and executes utility commands.
        2. printenv - prints environment variables.
        3. nano - simple text editor in the command line.
        4. awk - pattern scanning and processing language, useful for text processing and data extraction.
        5. sed - stream editor for filtering and transforming text.
        6. Pipe operator | - takes the output of one command and uses it as the input for another command.
    

#Flags in CLI:

   Flags, also known as options or switches, are special parameters used in command-line interfaces (CLI) to modify the behavior of commands. They typically begin with a dash (-) for single-letter flags or two dashes (--) for more descriptive, multi-letter flags. Flags can enable additional features, specify particular actions, or alter the output format of commands.

#Why use Flags:

    1. Enhanced Functionality: Flags can unlock additional functionalities within commands, allowing for more complex and powerful operations.
    2. Customization: They allow users to customize the behavior of commands to fit specific needs.
    3. Efficiency: Using flags can save time and reduce the number of steps needed to achieve a desired outcome.


#Conclusion:

   In conclusion, Command Line Interface can be used to configure, navigate, and run any server or computer systemâ€™s applications via text commands. All operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, include a command-line interface to enable faster system interaction.
